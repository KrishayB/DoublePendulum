# DoublePendulum

### About:
This program simulates a double pendulum using Java. On the right, there are controls, and on the left, the pendulum is drawn. It uses equations found on [this](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html) website in order to change the angles for the pendulum. Comments are added if you would like to understand how the code works or make changes.

### Running the program:
1. Clone the repository, download the code, or copy/paste it into a .java file.
2. Compile and run `DoublePendulum.java` inside the `DoublePendulum` directory.
