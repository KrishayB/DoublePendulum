# DoublePendulum

### About:
- This program simulates a double pendulum using Java. On the right, there are controls, and on the left, the pendulum is drawn.
- It uses equations found on [this](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html) website in order to change the angles for the pendulum.
- Comments are added if you would like to understand how the code works or make changes.

### Running the program:
1. Clone the repository, download the code, or copy/paste it into a .java file.
2. Compile and run or use an editor that has a built-in compiler like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
